Map of castles in Poland, based on a list of castles compiled for the purpose of ham radio award Zamki w Polsce:
http://zamkisp.pl/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=64&Itemid=71

Markers are:
- Green - existing castle (preserved in good condition)
- Olive - ruin
- Red - fragments (e.g. remains of a castle incorporated into another building)
- Blue - location (known from archaeological research, or known only from historical documents with no surviving remains to modern day)

For the purpose of the list, a building qualifies as a castle if it's built with a defensive purpose, build of brick or stone, during Middle Ages or Renaissance.

After clicking a marker, the page displays a bubble showing name of the castle, and the castle identification code for the ham radio award.
